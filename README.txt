Developed a movie recommendation system using a dataset containing movie titles, genres, and cleaned titles. Implemented a search engine that takes a movie title as input and suggests 5 similar movies based on TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. Utilized pandas and scikit-learn libraries for data preprocessing and recommendation calculations.

# Movie Recommendation Search Engine

This project implements a movie recommendation search engine using a dataset of movies and user ratings. The search engine allows users to input a movie title and receive recommendations for similar movies. The recommendations are generated based on movie titles and their genres using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Data Source

The project uses the MovieLens dataset, specifically the `movies.csv` file, which contains information about movie titles and genres.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the MovieLens dataset and aims to demonstrate a basic movie recommendation search engine using simple text processing and similarity techniques.
